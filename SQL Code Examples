INNER JOIN orders AS t2
ON t1.orderNumber = t2.orderNumber
INNER JOIN customers AS t3
ON t2.customerNumber = t3.customerNumber

ORDER BY total DESC            - так красивше

FROM `orderdetails` AS t1
INNER JOIN products AS t2
ON t1.productCode = t2.productCode
GROUP BY t1.productCode
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10


Задача 6
SELECT t2.lastName,

UNION
SELECT t2.lastName,
       t2.firstName,
       contactLastName,
       contactFirstName
FROM customers AS t1
RIGHT JOIN employees AS t2
ON t1.salesRepEmployeeNumber = t2.employeeNumber
Если надо было не весь список, а только не обслуживающих сотрудников и необслуженных клиентов, тогда так: (список будет из 30 позиций) (в верхнем случае 130 позиций)
SELECT t2.lastName,
       t2.firstName,
       contactLastName,
       contactFirstName

       t2.firstName,
       contactLastName,
       contactFirstName
FROM customers AS t1
RIGHT JOIN employees AS t2
ON t1.salesRepEmployeeNumber = t2.employeeNumber
WHERE contactLastName IS NULL


Задача 7
